First, its strategic location, with proximity to historical sites like Hoi An and Hue, makes it an ideal base for tourists.

Additionally, the hospitality and friendliness of the people, along with an expanding infrastructure, contribute to making Da Nang a popular destination for both domestic and international tourists."

First, the traffic congestion, especially during peak tourist seasons, can be quite frustrating. The city's infrastructure is still developing, and road conditions or the lack of efficient public transportation can hinder the overall experience. Additionally, while the popularity of Da Nang has been rising, some tourist attractions could benefit from better management in terms of cleanliness and facilities. Finally, more focus on sustainable tourism practices would help preserve the natural beauty of the area for future generations.
